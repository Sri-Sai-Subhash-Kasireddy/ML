### Supervised Learning 
#### Regression: I have used several regression models to make the predictions. Below are the links to the projects.

[Linear Regression](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LGQLPbNpL7avMILFryOIgNpKIKrZIMSm?usp=sharing): In this regression problem, we are predicting the salary range of different individuals based on the years of experience. We have used metrics such as mean squared error and mean absolute error to test the linear regression model. We were successfully able to make the predictions with mean absolute error of approximately 6200$ respectively. We were able to make the predictions of a person who has about 10 years of experience.
